## Abstract 

This paper explores the relationship between women’s income and how many children they have, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2009 - 2018. The paper finds a negative relationship between a woman’s income and the number of children she has in the household. When added controls, we find that people with higher levels of education tend to have fewer children and minority women on average are likely to have a lower income and bear more children. The interaction term analysis illustrates that Hispanic females are more likely to withdraw their decision to bear additional children if their income level becomes high, whereas the income level has a less incremental effect on black females’ decision to have fewer children. Though the results of our econometric model are statistically and economically significant, there are limited policy interventions due to validity of the model and moral issues.
